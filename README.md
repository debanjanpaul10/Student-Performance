<h1>Student Performance of Educational Instituions</h1>
<h3>Basic Concept</h3>
<p>
    With the increase in competition and more educational facilities like online classes, online asssesments and others, students of today are getting more and more pressurized with growing demands in education and competition among classmates. Due to this more and more students are failing their exams and their grades are detoriating more and more every year leading to student depression and worse. To eradicate this, we need to find a solution to how to improve the quality of students and how to make them excel in their academic careers and build up their futures.

<h3>What we did</h3>
<p>
    As a simple way to help eradicate this issue, we gathered some data from an XYZ insitution about student performace in three test scores namely, Math Score, Reading Score and Writing Score and arranged them in a tabular format. We then based them with the help of some features like Gender, Race/Ethinicity, Parental Level of Education, Lunch Type and Test Preparation Course and then gathered the same for 1000 students of the educational institution. Then we used some Machine Learning knowledge to arrange and visualize the data to see what is the actual features that affect the scores of the students and what the educational institutes and the students can do to improve their score and hence the quality of education

<h3>What we found</h3>
<p>
    We found via some Machine Learning algorithms about the factors that influence the test scores of the candidates and displayed every bit of information on the PowerPoint Presentation in this project. Please checkout the Jupyter Notebook that contains the code and the PowerPoint Presentation that contains the research materials we found on the data and what we concluded from it.
